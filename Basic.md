- <b>How to check for sorted array</b>
Checks if the elements in range [first, last) are sorted in non-descending order.
The pair of iterators defining the range of elements to examine

- <b>Sum of digits of 2 consecutive numbers</b>
  S(a) denotes the sum of the digits of the number a in the decimal numeral system.
  In general, if the number n ends with k consecutive digits of 9, then it turns out that S(n+1)=S(n)+1−9k, since all these 9s will be replaced by 0s after adding one to the number n.
- <b>Number of ways of choosing k consecutive numbers out of n numbers</b>
  There is n-k+1 ways of choosing k consecutive numbers out of n numbers  
- <b>LCM(1..9) which is equal to 2520</b>
- <b> Strong form of piegeon hole principle</b>
  The strong form of the Pigeonhole Principle is a generalized version of the basic principle, and it is stated as follows:
  If n objects are distributed into m containers, and if n>k⋅m for some integer k, then at least one container will contain more than k objects.
